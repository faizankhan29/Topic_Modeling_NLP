# Topic_Modeling_NLP
Algorithms for topic modeling of text.

In this repository,I've implemented two most commonly used algorithms for Topic modeling of text with different features.

There are four variations I have implemented:

1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Term Frequency.
2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Inverse-Document Frequency.
3. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Term Frequency.
4. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Inverse-Document Frequency.

Check out the jupyter notebook!
